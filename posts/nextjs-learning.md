Next.js provides a frontend framework that takes React.js to whole new level in which developers like myself who are not a part
of the React discipline can explore and not feel overwhelmed with all of Reacts ideology. The quick starter learn guide is the best way 
to enter the world of Next.js and what it offers:

Features: 
- Hybrid: SSG and SSR 
- Fast Refresh 
- Typescript Support 
- API Routes 
- Code-Spiltting 

And with the major update release (just yesterday) Next.js 10 add support for Image Optimization, Analytics and Internationlization.
