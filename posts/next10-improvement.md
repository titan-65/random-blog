# Next 10 

As I say down earphones plugged in and watched the first ever Next.js Conf I was excited, COVID-19 seemed to have brought the
best out companies in this trying time. I was impressed by the quality on display, and I was even more mind blown with the
announcement that Next.js 10 is out and bringing with it some new features that would carry this framework to higher heights.
The new features announced:
- Built-Image Component and Auto Image Optimization 
- Next.js Analytics 
- Next.js Commerce 
- React 17 Support 
- Fast Refresh for MDX 
- And a host of others
 
 All these new features look solid, and the team at Vercel filled the enthusiasm on their faces made it feel like this was their biggest moment.
 However, I tempered my emotions to realise that some users may never use half of these features (unless you are testing)
 and not to mention all the other features that was there before. I personally have started to use Next and as a Developer
 I am glad for new tech it just means a greater push to get into the documentation more. The team at Vercel prides this framework 
 has the one to rule them all however before you can rule you have to conqueror and with other JAMstacks touting there ease of use mantra
 there is lots of work to be done.
